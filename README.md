## Featured Projects

### 1. NLP-Based Momentum Trading Strategy
**Directory:** `momentum_strategy_project/`

#### Summary
Enhanced momentum strategy combining transformer-based NLP sentiment analysis with traditional price momentum signals. Implements "Frog-in-the-Pan" detection algorithm to identify gradual sentiment shifts that persist 3-6 months beyond conventional momentum signals.

#### Technical Implementation
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Transformer models (BERT/RoBERTa) on 120,000+ earnings call transcripts (2010-2024)
- **Signal Construction:** Four-criteria gradual shift detection algorithm
- **Portfolio Optimization:** Mean-variance framework with turnover constraints
- **Backtesting:** Realistic transaction costs, slippage modeling
- **Validation:** Bootstrap confidence intervals, walk-forward analysis

#### Key Results
- **Alpha:** 370 bps annually with statistical significance (t = 2.58, p < 0.05)
- **Sharpe Ratio:** 1.32 (vs. 0.91 for price-only momentum)
- **Factor Independence:** 81% of returns unexplained by Fama-French factors

#### Technologies
`Python` `PyTorch` `Transformers` `CVXPY` `NumPy` `Pandas` `Scikit-learn` `Statsmodels`

### 2. Reinforcement Learning Pair Trading Strategy
**Directory:** `QTS/Final Project/`  

#### Summary
Deep reinforcement learning approach to cryptocurrency pair trading using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Features comprehensive post-strategy analysis with professional risk metrics, capacity constraints, and detailed performance attribution.

#### Critical Analysis & Improvements
- **Identified Issue:** Original RL agent overtrade (1,540 trades in 60 days) → 308% cost drag
- **Root Cause:** Flawed reward function penalized inaction, forcing unprofitable trades
- **Solutions Implemented:**
  - Redesigned reward function with cost awareness
  - Optimal hedge ratio calculation (OLS regression) replacing fixed 1:1 ratios
  - Dynamic position sizing based on volatility regime

#### Technologies
`Python` `OpenAI Gym` `Stable-Baselines3` `PyTorch` `NumPy` `Pandas` `Matplotlib`

#### Documentation
- [Contributions](Courses/QTS/Final%20Project/CONTRIBUTIONS.md) – My research and implementation work
- [Environment Code](Courses/QTS/Final%20Project/cmds/env_trading_final.py) – Production trading environment
- [Test Suite](Courses/QTS/Final%20Project/tests/) – Comprehensive unit tests

### 3. Machine Learning for Earnings Prediction
**Directory:** `NTRS-Project-Lab/`  

#### Summary
Replication and extension of "Fundamental Analysis via Machine Learning" (Cao & You, 2021). Implements ensemble machine learning algorithms to predict earnings changes and generate alpha through factor-based long-short portfolios.

#### Methodology
- **Fama-MacBeth Regressions:** Cross-sectional analysis with industry fixed effects
- **Model Ensemble:** XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks
- **Feature Engineering:** Fundamental characteristics from financial statements
- **Orthogonalization:** Residual earnings component isolated from benchmark forecasts
- **Backtesting:** Transaction cost modeling with realistic implementation friction

#### Technologies
`Python` `XGBoost` `LightGBM` `CatBoost` `TensorFlow` `Keras` `Scikit-learn` `Statsmodels` `Matplotlib` `Seaborn`

#### Documentation

## 📝 Research Philosophy

My approach to quantitative research emphasizes:

1. **Statistical Rigor:** Every strategy undergoes comprehensive validation including bootstrap confidence intervals, cross-validation, and regime analysis
2. **Production Quality:** All code follows software engineering best practices with proper testing, documentation, and error handling
3. **Realistic Implementation:** Transaction costs, slippage, market impact, and capacity constraints are integral to strategy development
4. **Academic Grounding:** Implementations build on peer-reviewed research while extending methodology with novel approaches
5. **Risk Management:** Comprehensive risk analytics using industry-standard metrics (VaR, CVaR, drawdowns, tail risk)
